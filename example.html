                <h1>Terminus By Hilary Mantel</h1>
                <p>On 9 January, shortly after eleven on a dark sleety morning, I saw my dead father on a train pulling out of Clapham Junction, bound for Waterloo.</p>
                <p>I <span class="clickable-word" 
                    data-word="glance" 
                    data-definition="To look quickly at something/somebody." 
                    data-example="He glanced at his watch before leaving the room.">
               glanced </span> away, not recognising him at once. We were on parallel tracks. When I looked back, the train had picked up speed, and carried him away.</p>
                <p>My mind at once moved ahead, to the concourse at Waterloo Station, and the meeting which I felt sure must occur. The train on which he was travelling was one of the old six-seater-carriage-and-corridor type, its windows near-opaque with the winter&rsquo;s accumulation, and a decade of grime plastered to its metal. I wondered where he&rsquo;d come from: Reading, Ascot? You&rsquo;ll understand that I travel in the region a good deal, and one gets to know the rolling-stock.</p>

                <p>1. Make sure you stay hidden at all times.</p>
                <p>2. Only <span class="highlighted-word" data-word="glance">glance</span> at your target. DON'T stare.</p>
                <p>3. Resort to murder, only if it's your final choice.</p>
                <p>4. Use everything you have at your disposal, anything is a weapon.</p>
                <p>5. Remember spy work is about observation more than action.</p>
                <p>6. Use a newspaper to cover your face and <span class="highlighted-word" data-word="glance">glance</span> up from it to stake out your target.</p>
