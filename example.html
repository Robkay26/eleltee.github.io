                <h1>Salah disappointed at lack of Liverpool contract offer and feels ‘more out than in’</h1>
                <p></p>
                <p>Mohamed Salah says he is disappointed Liverpool have not offered him a new contract and feels “probably more out than in” in terms of staying beyond the end of the season.</p>
                <p>The uncertainty around Salah’s future is one of the few areas of concern amid a brilliant start under Arne Slot, whose side are eight points clear at the top of the Premier League after 10 wins in his 12 league matches.</p>
                <p>Salah’s bombshell words will heighten Liverpool supporters’ fears that the forward will move on when his deal expires in the summer. “Well, we are almost in December and I haven’t received any offers yet to stay in the club,” the 32-year-old said. “I’m probably more out than in.”</p>  
                <p>He added: “You know I have been in the club for many years. There is no team like this. But in the end it is not in my hands. As I said before, it is December and I haven’t received anything yet about my future.”</p>
                <p>Asked if he was disappointed at the lack of offers from Liverpool, Salah replied: “Of course, yeah. I love the fans. The fans love me. In the end it is not in my hands or the fans’ hands. Let’s wait and see.”</p>

                <h1>Did Austin Seibert just suffer the most agonizing few minutes in NFL history?</h1>
                <p>In the dying moments of a crucial game against a hated rival, the Washington Commanders kicker was subjected to a brutal series of humiliations</p>
                <p>If you’re under the impression that NFL special teams this season have been especially wonky, you are completely and utterly correct.</p>
                <p>Still, as weird as it special teams had been through the first 11 weeks of the season, nothing could quite compare to what happened on Sunday. Kicker misses and miscues have been legion, but Sunday saw far more blunders than usual.</p>
                <p>Most prominent of all was Austin Seibert of the Washington Commanders. The seven-year veteran came into Sunday perfect on extra-points, and 25 of 27 on his field goal attempts, this season.</p>
                <p>And then came the utter disaster Seibert put himself in against the Dallas Cowboys in a 34-26 Commanders loss. With 48 seconds left in the first quarter, Seibert missed a 51-yard field goal. No surprise there, as his only two misses this season had come from 50 or more yards. Then, after Jayden Daniels scored a touchdown on a 17-yard run with 9:59 left in the third quarter, Seibert missed his first extra-point attempt of the season. It didn’t seem a huge deal: Washington still led 9-3 against a Dallas team who have been woeful all season.</p>
